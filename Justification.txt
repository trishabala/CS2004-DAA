In this graph, both Prim's and Kruskal's give the same minimum cost of 2. The paths are the same as well.
All six nodes in this graph have an in degree greater than 0, so there is a path from the source node S to the remaining nodes.
The algorithms give the minimum cost for this graph but they may not work in other directed graphs.

For Dijkstra's Algorithm, we get the following values for paths from S to the remaining nodes A, B, C, D and E.

S to
A  B  C  D  E
5  5  7  9  8

If the graph was undirected, the values would be the following.

S to 
A  B  C  D  E
5  5  4  3  8

Thus, Dijkstra's Algorithm works differently for directed and undirected graphs. It also doesn't work for negative weights as the values would be very different if the negative weights were positive.

I chose to write the programs in C because it runs faster and I find that it's more convenient to use arrays in C to organize my data.
